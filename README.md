# 4-Queen Problem Solver with Metaheuristic Algorithms

## Introduction
This repository contains Python code to solve the 4-Queen problem using metaheuristic algorithms.

## Problem Statement
The 4-Queen problem involves placing 4 queens on a 4x4 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

## Approach
This project implements the following metaheuristic algorithms to solve the 4-Queen problem:
- Hill Climbing Algorithm
- Genetic Algorithm
- Simulated Annealing

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (if any).
3. Run the Python scripts for each algorithm to solve the 4-Queen problem.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
